## Aspect Based Emotion Analysis

This repo contains the python and jupyter notebook files used for fine-tuning and applying a BERT-based model. It also contains files that were used to perform data pre-processing for labeling and training, as well as a shell script to run the easily adjust hyperparameters and run model training yourself. There's also an environment.yml. 

For more information on the model that is used and adjusted see [GRACE: Gradient Harmonized and Cascaded Labeling for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Huaishao Luo, Lei Ji, Tianrui Li, Nan Duan, Daxin Jiang. Findings of EMNLP, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10557).
